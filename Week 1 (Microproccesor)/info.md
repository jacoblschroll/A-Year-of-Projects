# Week 1 (1-Bit Microprocessor)

This project is based on the Motorola MC14500B's logic and architecture, although I've removed flags (at least for now).

The computer as a whole is made up of multiple components such as the:
- Program Counter
- Program Memory
- Instruction Unit
- Logic Unit
- Control Unit

The folders break each component down for a top-down approach to this project
