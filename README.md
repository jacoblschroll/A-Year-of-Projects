# A-Year-of-Projects

Since I needed a portfolio and wanted a place to show off the ideas I mess around with in my spare time, I decided to dedicate myself to making one project a week. Each week I will add whatever work I completed while exploring a new concept, building a project, or just fixing an everyday inconvience. Some will turn into longer term projects and some may never get an update.

Currently I have added:
- Week 0 (Jan 14 - Jan 20): GPT by API
- Week 1 (Jan 21 - Jan 27): Microprocessor
- Week 2 (Jan 28 - Feb 4): Edge CNN Accelerator
