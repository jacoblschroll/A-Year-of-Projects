## Week 2
Honestly I took on a bit too much this week, redesigning the architecture of a deep-learning accelerator is pretty darn difficult. I made some really good progress this week and I think it would be a waste to just throw together the last bit and lose a lot of features sooooo...

#### Week 3 is Part 2!

Most of what is being added this week will just be higher level design documents and a write up on the features and applications of this, but given the complexity I would not mind having a well documented project.
